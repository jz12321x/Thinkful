What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
	select * from sfo_listings order by price desc;
	A 'full victorian house' with a minimum stay of 2 nights

What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
select sum(number_of_reviews) as total_reviews, neighbourhood from sfo_listings group by neighbourhood order by total_reviews desc;
Mission has the most reviews/activity, followed by Western Addition and Castro/Upper Market

What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? What about the busiest?


select count(*), date_part('month',calender_date) as mon from sfo_calendar 
where available='t' group by mon ;

select count(*), date_part('month',review_date)as mon from sfo_reviews group by mon order by count desc;
It seems the wintertime is the time most listings are available, but summertime is when the most reviews come in.

select avg(price::money::numeric) as pr, date_part('month',calender_date)as mon 
from sfo_calendar where price != 'null'
group by mon
order by pr desc;
These results seem very arbitrary, September has the cheapest average price, followed by October and July.
