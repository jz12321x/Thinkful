The IDs and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration.
select trip_id, duration from trips where duration>500 order by duration desc;

Every column of the stations table for station id 84.
select * from stations where station_id=84;

The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301.
select mintemperaturef from weather where zip=94301;

----MOD5---------------------------------------------------------------
What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?
SELECT date, zip, max(maxtemperaturef) FROM weather GROUP BY maxtemperaturef, zip, date ORDER BY maxtemperaturef desc;
select date,zip,maxtemperaturef from weather where maxtemperaturef = (select max(maxtemperaturef) from weather);

How many trips started at each station?
SELECT count(trip_id), start_station  FROM trips GROUP BY start_station;

What's the shortest trip that happened?
select trip_id, duration from trips where duration = (select min(duration) from trips);

What is the average trip duration, by end station?
select avg(duration), end_station from trips group by end_station;

----MOD6--------------------------------------------------------------
What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

Which station is full most often?
with f as (
select * from status where docks_available=0
)
select
	count(*) as ct,
	station_id
from f
group by station_id
